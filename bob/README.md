# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whatever.' if you tell him something.

He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

## Instructions

Run the test file, and fix each of the errors in turn. When you get the first test to pass, go to the first pending or skipped test, and make that pass as well. When all of the tests are passing, feel free to submit.

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make it.

Have fun!
