# Introduction

## Numbers

Lua uses two representations for numbers: 64-bit integer numbers and double-precision floating-point numbers. It supports the usual set of arithmetic operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and negation. Additionally it supports floor division, modulo and exponentiation.

| Operator | Example             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| `+`      | `1 + 2 --> 3`       |
| `-`      | `2 - 1 --> 1`       |
| `*`      | `2 * 2 --> 4`       |
| `/`      | `4 * 2 --> 2.0`     |
| `//`     | `11 * 3 --> 3`      |
| `%`      | `11 % 3 --> 2`      |
| `^`      | `10 ^ 2 --> 100.0`  |
| `-`      | `-(2 * 2) --> 4`    |
