Exercism exercises in Lua

## Configuring a Development Development and Contributing

Install Lua and Luarocks according to the [installation instructions][1] for your platform.
Then, install all additional development dependencies with:

```shell
$ ./bin/install-dev-dependencies
```

To contribute a patch you will need a GitHub account and you will need to fork
the *exercism/lua* repo to your account.
Clone your fork with the command: `git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/lua`.
Create your patch and open a pull request to the exercism/lua repo.

See the GitHub Help for [forking a repo][2] and [creating a pull request][3]
if you are unfamiliar with this process.

To contribute a new exercise, create a folder named after the exercise within the
*lua/exercises* directory. Create your files for a new test, test class and the implementation.

For example, for the [Bob][4] exercise:

    $ tree bob
    bob
    ├── bob_spec.lua
    └── bob.lua

    0 directories, 2 files

Run the test

    $ busted

Rename *bob.lua* to *example.lua*, and add the exercise to the [lua/config.json][5] file.

    $ tree bob
    bob
    ├── bob_spec.lua
    └── example.lua

    0 directories, 2 files

Optionally, you can generate the spec from the upstream canonical data.
To use the spec generator, create a file called `spec_generator.lua` in the `.meta/` directory of the exercise.
This file should be a Lua module returning a table with two fields:
- `module_name` - A string containing the name of the Lua variable to which the module under test will be bound.
- `generate_test` - A function that returns a string representation of a test given the corresponding case from the canonical data.

Optionally, a third field can be included:
- `test_helpers` - A string that will be injected at the top of the outermost `describe` block. This can include helper functions that are used in multiple tests or other setup code.

To use the test generator, run:

```shell
$ ./bin/generate-spec <exercise name>
```

This will use `curl` to fetch the canonical data from the upstream repository, generate the spec file, and format it.

## Contributing Guide

Please be familiar with the [contributing guide][6] in the docs repository.
This describes some great ways to get involved. In particular, please read the
[Pull Request Guidelines][7] before opening a pull request.

## Lua icon
The Lua icon is inspired by the [Lua logo][9], which was designed by Alexandre Nakonechnyj.
