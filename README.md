# Exercism Lua Track

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/lua.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/lua)

Exercism exercises in Lua

## Setup dev environment for contributing

Install Lua, Luarocks, and the Busted testing framework according to the
[installation instructions][1] for your platform.

To contribute a patch you will need a GitHub account and you will need to fork
the *exercism/lua* repo to your account.
Clone your fork with the command: `git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/lua`.
Create your patch and open a pull request to the exercism/lua repo.

See the GitHub Help for [forking a repo][2] and [creating a pull request][3]
if you are unfamiliar with this process.

To contribute a new exercise, create a folder named after the exercise within the
*lua/exercises* directory. Create your files for a new test, test class and the implementation.

For example, for the [Bob][4] exercise:

    $ tree bob
    bob
    ├── bob_spec.lua
    └── bob.lua

    0 directories, 2 files

Run the test

    $ busted

Rename *bob.lua* to *example.lua*, and add the exercise to the [lua/config.json][5] file.

    $ tree bob
    bob
    ├── bob_spec.lua
    └── example.lua

    0 directories, 2 files
